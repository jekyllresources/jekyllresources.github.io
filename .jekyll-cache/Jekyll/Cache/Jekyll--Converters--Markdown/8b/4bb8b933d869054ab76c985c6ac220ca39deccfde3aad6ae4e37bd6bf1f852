I"}<p>Hi Jekyllers,</p>

<p>We have patched a <strong>critical vulnerability</strong> reported to GitHub a couple of weeks ago and have released a set of new gems to
bring that patch to you. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary file reads with the cunning use of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include:</code> setting in the
config file.</p>

<p>By simply including a symlink in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include</code> array allowed the symlinked file to be read into the build when they shouldn’t
actually be read in any circumstance.  
Further details regarding the patch can be viewed at the <a href="https://github.com/jekyllresources/jekyllresources.github.io/pull/7224">pull request URL</a></p>

<p>The patch has been released as versions <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.6.3</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.7.4</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.8.4</code>.  
Thanks to @parkr <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v3.7.4</code> was released a couple of weeks prior and has been bundled with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">github-pages-v192</code>.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that this issue affects <em>all previously released Jekyll versions</em>. If you have not had
a good reason to upgrade to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.6</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.7</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3.8</code> yet, we advise that you do so at the earliest.</p>

<p>As always, Happy Jekylling! :sparkles:</p>
