I"‚<p>This year, Jekyll applied to be a part of <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/">Google Summer of Code</a>. Students were able to propose any project related to Jekyll. With a gracious sponsorship from GitHub and the participation of myself, @benbalter and @jldec, Jekyll was able to accept two students for the 2016 season, @mertkahyaoglu and @rush-skills.</p>
