I"ø<p>This year, Jekyll applied to be a part of <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/">Google Summer of Code</a>. Students were able to propose any project related to Jekyll. With a gracious sponsorship from GitHub and the participation of myself, @benbalter and @jldec, Jekyll was able to accept two students for the 2016 season, @mertkahyaoglu and @rush-skills.</p>

<p>These students are working on a project that fills a huge need for the community: <em>a graphical solution for managing your siteâ€™s content.</em> Current plans include a fully-integrated admin which spins up when you run jekyll serve and provides a friendly web interface for creating and editing your content. The server and web interface will speak a common HTTP interface so either piece could be switched out for, e.g. a server which writes directly to a repository on GitHub.</p>

<p>The strength of text files as the storage medium for content has been part of Jekyllâ€™s success. <a href="/">Our homepage</a> lauds the absence of a traditional SQL database when using Jekyll â€“ your content should be what demands your time, not pesky database downtime. Unfortunately, understanding of the structure of a Jekyll site takes some work, enough that for some users, itâ€™s prohibitive to using Jekyll to accomplish their publishing goals.</p>

<p>Mert and Ankur both applied to take on this challenge and agreed to split the project, one taking on the web interface and the other taking on the backend. Weâ€™re very excited to see a fully-functional CMS for Jekyll at the end of the summer produced by these excellent community members, and we hope youâ€™ll join us in cheering them on and sharing our gratitude for all their hard work.</p>

<p>Thanks, as always, for being part of such a wonderful community that made this all possible. Iâ€™m honored to work with each of you to create something folks all around the globe find a joy to use. I look forward to our continued work to move Jekyll forward.</p>

<p>As always, Happy Jekylling!</p>
