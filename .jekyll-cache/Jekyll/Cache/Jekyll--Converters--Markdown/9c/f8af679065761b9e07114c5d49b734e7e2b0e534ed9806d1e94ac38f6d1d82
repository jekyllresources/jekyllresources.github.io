I"D<p>Hello Jekyllers!!</p>

<p>Today we are releasing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v3.8.2</code>, which fixes the way Jekyll generates excerpts
for posts when the first paragraph of the post contains Liquid tags that take
advantage of <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/whitespace/">Liquidâ€™s whitespace control feature</a>.</p>

<p>Big thanks to @kylebarbour, who first reported this issue and also very quickly
submitted a fix. Also thanks to @nickskalkin for making sure that we are using
the latest version of Rubocop to lint our code.</p>
