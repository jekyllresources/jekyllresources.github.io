I"e	<p>Pages are the most basic building block for content. They’re useful for standalone
content (content which is not date based or is not a group of content such as staff
members or recipes).</p>

<p>The simplest way of adding a page is to add an HTML file in the root
directory with a suitable filename. You can also write a page in Markdown using
a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> extension which converts to HTML on build. For a site with
a homepage, an about page, and a contact page, here’s what the root directory
and associated URLs might look like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.
├── about.md    # =&gt; http://example.com/about.html
├── index.html    # =&gt; http://example.com/
└── contact.html  # =&gt; http://example.com/contact.html
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you have a lot of pages, you can organize them into subfolders. The same subfolders that are used to group your pages in your project’s source will then exist in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code> folder when your site builds. However, when a page has a <em>different</em> permalink set in the front matter, the subfolder at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code> changes accordingly.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.
├── about.md          # =&gt; http://example.com/about.html
├── documentation     # folder containing pages
│   └── doc1.md       # =&gt; http://example.com/documentation/doc1.html
├── design            # folder containing pages
│   └── draft.md      # =&gt; http://example.com/design/draft.html
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="changing-the-output-url">Changing the output URL</h2>

<p>You might want to have a particular folder structure for your source files that changes for the built site. With <a href="/docs/permalinks">permalinks</a> you have full control of the output URL.</p>

<h2 id="excerpts-for-pages">Excerpts for pages</h2>

<p>From Jekyll 4.1.1 onwards, one can <em>choose</em> to generate excerpts for their pages by setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page_excerpts</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> in their
config file.</p>
