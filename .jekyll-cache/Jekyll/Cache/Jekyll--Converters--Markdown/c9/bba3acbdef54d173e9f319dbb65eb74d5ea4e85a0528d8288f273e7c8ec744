I"/<p>Happy Friday from sunny California! Today, we’re excited to announce the release of Jekyll v3.1.2, which comes with some crucial bug fixes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a syntax error is encountered by Liquid, it will now print the line number.</li>
  <li>A nasty war between symbols and strings in our configuration hash caused kramdown syntax highlighting to break. That has been resolved; you stand victorious!</li>
  <li>A tilde at the beginning of a filename will no longer crash Jekyll.</li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">titleize</code> filter mistakenly dropped words that were already capitalized. Fixed!</li>
  <li>Permalinks which end in a slash will now always output as a folder with an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> inside.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nitty-gritty details, like always, are available in the <a href="/docs/history/">history</a>.</p>
