I"ñ<p>This release squashes a few bugs :bug: :bug: :bug: noticed by a few
wonderful Jekyll users:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">permalink</code> ended with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>, your URL didnâ€™t have any extension,
even if you wanted one</li>
  <li>We now strip the BOM by default per Rubyâ€™s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IO.open</code>.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page.dir</code> will not always end in a slash.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also updated our <a href="/docs/conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> to the latest version of
the Contributor Covenant. The update includes language to ensure that the
reporter of the incident remains confidential to non-maintainers and that
all complaints will result in an appropriate response. I care deeply about
Jekyllâ€™s community and will do everything in my power to ensure it is a
welcoming community. Feel free to reach out to me directly if you feel
there is a way we can improve the community for everyone! If youâ€™re
interested in more details, <a href="https://github.com/ContributorCovenant/contributor_covenant/blob/v1_4/diffs/1_3_vs_1_4.patch">there is a diff for
that</a>.</p>

<p>See links to the PRâ€™s on <a href="/docs/history/#v3-1-1">the history page</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to Jordon Bedwell, chrisfinazzo, Kroum Tzanev, David Celis, and
Alfred Xing for their commits on this latest release! :sparkles:</p>

<p>Happy Jekylling!</p>
