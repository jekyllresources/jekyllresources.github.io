<div class="note warning">
  <h5>Incremental regeneration is still an experimental feature</h5>
  <p>
    While incremental regeneration will work for the most common cases, it will
    not work correctly in every scenario. Please be extremely cautious when
    using the feature, and report any problems not listed below by
    <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/new">opening an issue on GitHub</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<p>Incremental regeneration helps shorten build times by only generating documents
and pages that were updated since the previous build. It does this by keeping
track of both file modification times and inter-document dependencies in the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.jekyll-metadata</code> file.</p>

<p>Under the current implementation, incremental regeneration will only generate a
document or page if either it, or one of its dependencies, is modified. Currently,
the only types of dependencies tracked are includes (using the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{% include %}</code> tag) and layouts. This means that plain
references to other documents (for example, the common case of iterating over
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site.posts</code> in a post listings page) will not be detected as a dependency.</p>

<p>To remedy some of these shortfalls, putting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">regenerate: true</code> in the front-matter
of a document will force Jekyll to regenerate it regardless of whether it has been
modified. Note that this will generate the specified document only; references
to other documents’ contents will not work since they won’t be re-rendered.</p>

<p>Incremental regeneration can be enabled via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--incremental</code> flag (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-I</code> for
short) from the command-line or by setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">incremental: true</code> in your
configuration file.</p>
