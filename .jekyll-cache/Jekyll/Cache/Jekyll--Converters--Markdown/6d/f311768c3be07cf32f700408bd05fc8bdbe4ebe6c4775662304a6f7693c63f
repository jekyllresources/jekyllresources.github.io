I"^<p>Upon releasing 3.1.5 and kicking the tires, we noticed a glaring bug: our
beloved <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jsonify</code> filter doesnâ€™t work! With that, our work was cut out for
us and we decided a 3.1.6 was necessary. This release restores sanity to
our object-to-JSON generation in Liquid and we hope you enjoy.</p>
