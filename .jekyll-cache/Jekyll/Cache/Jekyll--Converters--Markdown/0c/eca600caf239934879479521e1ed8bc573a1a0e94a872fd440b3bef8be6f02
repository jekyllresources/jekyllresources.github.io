I"<p>A very minor release, 2.5.2 fixes a bug with path sanitation that 2.5.1
introduced. It also improves the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">post_url</code> tag such that it checks the
postsâ€™ name (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2014-03-03-my-cool-post</code>) instead of a compiled time and
name. This fixes issues where posts are created and the day changes based
on timezone discrepancies.</p>
