I"<p>Well, 3.2.0 has been a success, but with one fatal flaw: it doesnâ€™t work on
Windows! Sorry, Windows users. Hot on the trail of 3.2.0, this release
should squash that :bug:. Sorry about that!</p>

<p>This release also fixes an issue when using <a href="/docs/themes/">gem-based themes</a>
where the theme was rejected if it existed behind a symlink. This is a
common setup for the various ruby version managers, and for Ruby installed
via Homebrew. Props to @benbalter for fixing that up.</p>

<p>Thanks to the contributors for this release: Adam Petrie, Ben Balter,
Daniel Chapman, DirtyF, Gary Ewan Park, Jordon Bedwell, and Parker Moore.</p>

<p>As always, you can see our full changelog on <a href="/docs/history/">the History page</a>.</p>

<p>Happy Jekylling!</p>
