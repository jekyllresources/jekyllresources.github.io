I"ð<p>A crucial bug was found in v3.0.1 which caused invalid post dates to go
unnoticed in the build chain until the error that popped up was unhelpful.
v3.0.2 <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/4375">throws errors as youâ€™d expect</a>
when there is a post like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_posts/2016-22-01-future.md</code> or a post has an
invalid date like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date: "tuesday"</code> in their front matter.</p>
