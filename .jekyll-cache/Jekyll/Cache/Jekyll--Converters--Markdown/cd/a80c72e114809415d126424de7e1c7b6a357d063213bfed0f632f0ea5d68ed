I"*<p>Quick turnover, anyone? A <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/1525">recent incompatibility with Liquid
v2.5.2</a> produced a nasty bug in
which <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include</code> tags were not rendered properly within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> blocks.</p>

<p>This release also includes a better handling of detached servers (prints pid and
the command for killing the process). <strong>Note</strong>: the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--detach</code> flag and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--watch</code> flags are presently incompatible in 1.2.x. Fix for that coming soon!</p>

<p>For a full list of the fixes in this release, check out <a href="/docs/history/">the change
log</a>!</p>
