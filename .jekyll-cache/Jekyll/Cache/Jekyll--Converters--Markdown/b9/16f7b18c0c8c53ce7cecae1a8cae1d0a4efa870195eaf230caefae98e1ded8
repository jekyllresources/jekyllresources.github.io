I"ô<p>Weâ€™re excited to announce that <a href="https://github.com/alfredxing">@alfredxing</a> has joined the @jekyll/core
team!</p>

<p>He hails from Vancouver, BC, Canada, where he is studying Economics and
Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.ubc.ca">University of British Columbia</a>. Alfred popped up in
the issues a few months ago with terrific insights, focus, and humility.
Performance buffs may be pleased to hear incremental regeneration will be
released in a future version of Jekyll â€“ a significant piece of the
feature written by Alfred.</p>

<p>Please join me in welcoming Alfred to the Jekyll core team. Weâ€™re excited
heâ€™s agreed to lend his talents to this project. The future is an exciting
place!</p>

<p>Happy Jekylling!</p>
