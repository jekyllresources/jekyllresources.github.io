I"ê<p>Weâ€™re super excited to announce the launch of <a href="https://talk.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll Talk</a>, a Discourse forum for anything related to Jekyll!</p>

<p>The forum was set up by <a href="https://github.com/envygeeks">@envygeeks</a> to build a community more accessible to Jekyll users and more suitable for general discussion.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s already been a lot of interesting topics, including a site showcase and a poll for Jekyll 3.0 priorities.</p>

<p>Come join the fun!</p>
