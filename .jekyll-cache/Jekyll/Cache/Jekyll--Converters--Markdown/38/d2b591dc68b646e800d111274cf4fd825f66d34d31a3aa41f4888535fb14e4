I"¹<p>Another quick turnover, anyone? A <a href="https://github.com/jekyllresources/jekyllresources.github.io/issues/1794">critical
bug</a> in the reading of
posts snuck itself into the 1.4.0 release.</p>

<p>To address this issue, weâ€™re releasing v1.4.1 of Jekyll so that you can
keep on writing without any problems.</p>

<p>As always, you can find the full list of fixes in this release in the
<a href="/docs/history/">change log</a>!</p>
