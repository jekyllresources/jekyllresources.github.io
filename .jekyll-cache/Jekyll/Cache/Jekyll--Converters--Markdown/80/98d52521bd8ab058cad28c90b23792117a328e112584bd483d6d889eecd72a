I"˜<p>Version 1.0.4 fixes a minor, but nonetheless important security vulnerability affecting several third-party Jekyll plugins. If your Jekyll site does not use plugins, you may, but are not required to upgrade at this time.</p>

<p>Community and custom plugins extending the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Liquid::Drop</code> class may inadvertently disclose some system information such as directory structure or software configuration to users with access to the Liquid templating system.</p>

<p>We recommend you upgrade to Jekyll v1.0.4 immediately if you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Liquid::Drop</code> plugins on your Jekyll site.</p>

<p>Many thanks for <a href="https://github.com/benbalter">Ben Balter</a> for alerting us to the problem
and <a href="https://github.com/jekyllresources/jekyllresources.github.io/issues/1349">submitting a patch</a> so quickly.</p>
