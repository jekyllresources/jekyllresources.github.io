I"3<p>Happy May Day :tada:</p>

<p>The Jekyll team is happy to announce the release of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v3.8.1</code>, which fixes
a couple of bugs that were introduced two weeks ago in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v3.8.0</code>. If you have
experienced trouble regarding post excerpts or non-published posts, this release
should be the remedy. Thanks to @Chaosed0 and @domLocalHeroes for originally
reporting these issues, and to @ashmaroli for fixing them so quickly.</p>

<p>As a reminder, we have started work on Jekyll 4.0. If there are any
features that you would love to see added to Jekyll, or any pain points you
would like to see removed, please do add your ideas to the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/6948">Jekyll 4.0 idea
list</a>.</p>
