I"”<p>Hey there! We have a quick update of Jekyll for you to enjoy this January.
Packed full of bug fixes as usual, thanks to the tireless efforts of our
exceptional Jekyll community. Three changes to call out:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If youâ€™re a big fan of <a href="/docs/liquid/filters/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">where_by_exp</code></a>, youâ€™ll be an
even bigger fan of <a href="/docs/liquid/filters/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">group_by_exp</code></a>.</li>
  <li>Using a custom timezone in Jekyll on Windows? Yeah, sorry that hasnâ€™t ever worked
properly. We made it possible to accurately <a href="/docs/installation/windows/#time-zone-management">set the timezone using IANA
timezone codes</a>.</li>
  <li>Documentation has been improved, notably on themes, includes and permalinks.</li>
</ol>

<p>And <a href="/docs/history/#v3-4-0">lots and lots more!</a></p>
