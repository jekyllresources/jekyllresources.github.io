I"E<p>v3.1.3 is a patch release which fixes the follow two issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Front matter defaults may not have worked for collection documents and posts due to a problem where they were looked up by their URL rather than their path relative to the site source</li>
  <li>Running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> with SSL enabled was broken due to a bad configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these issues have been resolved. For more information, check out <a href="/docs/history/#v3-1-3">the full history</a>.</p>

<p>Happy Jekylling!</p>
