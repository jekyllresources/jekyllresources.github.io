I"}<p>3.6.2 is out, it’s a tiny patch release and we invite you to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle update</code>
if you want to avoid possible build problems with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>some UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoded files,</li>
  <li>fully numeric layout names (we convert those to string for you now).</li>
</ul>

<p>Other changes include updates to our documentation, like this <a href="/tutorials/video-walkthroughs/">complete
video series by Giraffe Academy</a> aimed at
complete beginners. A big thanks to Mike for this.</p>

<p>And if you’re wondering what happened to version 3.6.1, it was just our new
release maintainer getting familiar with the release process. 😄</p>

<p>We try to release patch releases as quickly as possible and we’re already
working on the next minor version 3.7.0 that will allow you to store all your
collections in a single directory. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Theme developers are invited to test the brand new
<a href="https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-remote-theme</code></a> plugin
and give their feedback to @benbalter. This plugin allows you to use any
GitHub hosted theme as a remote theme!</p>

<p>Once again, many thanks to our contributors who helped make this release possible:
ashmaroli, bellvat, Frank Taillandier, i-give-up, Jan Piotrowski, Maximiliano
Kotvinsky, Oliver Steele and Pat Hawks. For some it was their <a href="/news/2017/10/19/diversity-open-source/">first
contribution to open-source</a> 👏</p>

<p>As it’s been nine years this week that Tom Preston-Werner started this project,
I also wanna seize this opportunity to thank <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/graphs/contributors">all of the 732 contributors</a> who
helped make it possible for Jekyll to power millions of websites around the world
today.</p>

<p>Happy Birthday Jekyll! 🎂</p>
