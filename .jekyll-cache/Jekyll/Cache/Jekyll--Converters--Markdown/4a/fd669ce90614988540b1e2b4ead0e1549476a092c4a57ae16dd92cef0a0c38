I"®<p>Jekyll 1.3.0 is going to be a big release! In order to make sure we
didnâ€™t screw anything up too badly, weâ€™re making a release candidate
available for any early adopters who want to give the latest and
greatest code a spin without having to clone a repository from git.</p>

<p>Please take this prerelease for a spin and <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/new">let us
know</a> if you run into any
issues!</p>
