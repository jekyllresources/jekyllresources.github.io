I"U<p>Hey!</p>

<p>Exciting news! First beta for Jekyll 3 is out. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/v3.0.0.beta1/History.markdown#head">sizable
changelog</a>
to get a feel for what changes are afoot. Key features:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Jekyll now features incremental regeneration and greatly
improved problematic code that caused slow-downs.</li>
  <li>Gobs of bugfixes and customization.</li>
  <li>Uniformity and sanity to Jekyll extensions of Liquid.</li>
</ol>

<p>To install just run:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="nv">$ </span>gem <span class="nb">install </span>jekyll <span class="nt">--pre</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Future versions will include <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/3324">some awesome new
features</a> that we haven’t
built yet. If you see one you want to tackle, submit a PR &amp; you’ll be
featured in the Jekyll 3.0 release post as a contributor to that epic
release.</p>

<p>Please file bugs as you encounter them, being sure to include your version
of Ruby, the Jekyll version, and (if possible) a link to your site so we
can reproduce.</p>

<p>If you think there’s room for improvement in the UX, also do let us know.
We’re always looking to make Jekyll easier to use!</p>

<p>Happy Jekylling!</p>
