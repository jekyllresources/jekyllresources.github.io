I"-<p>Close on the heels of shipping 3.7.0, we were informed of a couple of
regressions due to the changes made in that release. In due time, Team Jekyll
set out to address those issues as early as possible.</p>

<p>Days later here we’re, announcing 3.7.2 (sorry for skipping 3.7.1,
RubyGems didn’t want to play nice) that fixes numerous issues! :tada:
The highlights being:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A major regression in 3.7.0 was that when a Front Matter Default was
configured with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scope["path"]</code> set to a directory, Jekyll would scan
that directory for any subfolders and files, for each document in that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">path</code>.
Though this is intended, it increases build times in proportion to the size
of the directory.</p>

    <p>We addressed this by having Jekyll scan the directory path only if the user
explicitly configures the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scope["path"]</code> using wildcards.</p>

    <p>Read our <a href="/docs/configuration/front-matter-defaults/#glob-patterns-in-front-matter-defaults">documentation</a>
for more details.</p>

    <p>A huge shout-out to @mmistakes for bringing this to our notice and
additionally providing us with a test repository to aid in resolving the issue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another regression reported was related to our “Custom collections
directory” feature introduced in 3.7.0.</p>

    <p>Users setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collection_dir</code> to a certain directory would have <em>altered</em>
paths to their posts still at the root of their site’s source. This
roughly translated to 404 errors on URLs to their posts.</p>

    <p>Props to @localheinz for bringing this regression to our notice.</p>

    <p>We decided to resolve this by having Jekyll ignore posts and drafts at the
root of the site’s source directory if the user customizes the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collection_dir</code> setting.</p>

    <p>Ergo, if you set a custom location for your collections, please ensure you
move all of your collections into that directory. <strong>This includes posts and
drafts as well</strong>. Your links generated by
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{% post_url %}</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{% link %}</code>
will adapt automatically.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We also found out that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem "wdm"</code> boosts performance while directories are
being watched on Windows. So we recommend having it included in your Gemfile
for a better development experience on Windows. (Newly generated Gemfiles
will hereafter have that gem listed automatically :wink:)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the above, numerous other minor fixes and documentation updates
have been made that should improve your Jekyll experience. All of which, would
not have been possible without our wonderful contributors:</p>

<p>Alexandr, Andreas Möller, Ashwin Maroli, Chayoung You, Florian Thomas,
Frank Taillandier, Hendrik Schneider, Kacper Duras, Olivia, Parker Moore and
Paul Robert Lloyd.</p>

<p>As always, you can see our full changelog on <a href="/docs/history/">the History page</a>.</p>

<p>Happy Jekylling! :sparkles:</p>
