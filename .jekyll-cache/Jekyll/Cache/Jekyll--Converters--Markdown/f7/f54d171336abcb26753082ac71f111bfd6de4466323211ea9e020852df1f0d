<p class="note info"><strong>This guide is for maintainers.</strong> These special people have <strong>write access</strong> to one or more of Jekyll‚Äôs repositories and help merge the contributions of others. You may find what is written here interesting, but it‚Äôs definitely not for everyone.</p>

<h1 id="1-use-jekyll">1. Use Jekyll</h1>

<p>Maintainers of Jekyll should be using it regularly. This is partly because you won‚Äôt be a good maintainer unless you can put yourself in the shoes of our users, but also because you may at some point decide to stop using Jekyll, and at that point you should also decide to stop being a maintainer and find other things to work on.</p>

<h1 id="2-no-guilt-about-leaving">2. No Guilt About Leaving</h1>

<p>All maintainers can stop working on Jekyll at any time without any guilt or explanation (like at a job). We may still ask for your help with questions after you leave but you are under no obligation to answer them. If you create a big mess and then leave you still have no obligations but we may think less of you (or, realistically, probably just revert the problematic work). Also, you should probably take a break from Jekyll at least a few times a year.</p>

<p>This also means contributors should be consumers. If a maintainer finds they are not using a project in the real-world, they should reconsider their involvement with the project.</p>

<h1 id="3-prioritise-maintainers-over-users">3. Prioritise Maintainers Over Users</h1>

<p>It‚Äôs important to be user-focused but ultimately, as long as you follow #1 above, Jekyll‚Äôs minimum number of users will be the number of maintainers. However, if Jekyll has no maintainers it will quickly become useless to all users and the project will die. As a result, no user complaint, behaviour or need takes priority over the burnout of maintainers. If users do not like the direction of the project, the easiest way to influence it is to make significant, high-quality code contributions and become a maintainer.</p>

<h1 id="4-learn-to-say-no">4. Learn To Say No</h1>

<p>Jekyll gets a lot of feature requests, non-reproducible bug reports, usage questions and PRs we won‚Äôt accept. These should be closed out as soon as we realise that they aren‚Äôt going to be resolved or merged. This is kinder than deciding this after a long period of review. Our issue tracker should reflect work to be done.</p>
