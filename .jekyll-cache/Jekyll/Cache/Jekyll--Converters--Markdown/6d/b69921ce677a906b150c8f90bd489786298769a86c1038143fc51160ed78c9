<p>Another one-PR patch update, though without the same <a href="/news/2017/03/02/jekyll-3-4-1-released/">lessons as for the
previous release</a>.</p>

<p>This release includes a beneficial change for a number of plugins:
<strong>static files now respect front matter defaults</strong>.</p>

<p>You might be asking yourself: ‚Äúwhy would static files, files that are
static files explicitly because they <em>don‚Äôt</em> have front matter, want
to respect front matter?‚Äù That‚Äôs a great question. Let me illustrate
with an example.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-sitemap</code>. This plugin generates a list of documents,
pages, and static files, and some metadata for them in an XML file for a
Google/Yahoo/Bing/DuckDuckGo crawler to consume. If you don‚Äôt want a given
file in this list, you set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sitemap: false</code> in front matter. But
what about static files, which don‚Äôt have front matter? Before this
release, they could not be excluded because they had no properties in YAML
other than <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/v3.4.1/lib/jekyll/static_file.rb#L98-L106">the ones we explicitly assigned</a>.
So if you had a PDF you didn‚Äôt want to be in your sitemap, you couldn‚Äôt use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-sitemap</code>.</p>

<p>With this release, you can now set <a href="/docs/configuration/front-matter-defaults/">front matter
defaults</a> for static files:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">defaults</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span>
    <span class="na">scope</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="na">path</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">pdfs/"</span>
    <span class="na">values</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="na">sitemap</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="no">false</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, for every file in the Liquid <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site.static_files</code> loop which is in the
folder <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pdfs/</code>, you‚Äôll see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sitemap</code> equal to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code>.</p>

<p>Many thanks to @benbalter for coming up with the solution and ensuring
sitemaps everywhere are filled with just the right content.</p>

<p>As always, if you notice any bugs, please search the issues and file one if
you can‚Äôt find another related to your issue.</p>

<p>Happy Jekylling!</p>
