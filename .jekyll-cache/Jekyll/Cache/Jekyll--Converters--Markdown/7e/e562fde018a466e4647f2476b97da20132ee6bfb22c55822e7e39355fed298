I":<p>Happy Holidays, everyone.</p>

<p>Jekyll v2.5.3 is a quick patch release, containing some minor fixes. See the
<a href="/docs/history/">full history</a> for more info. If you notice any problems,
please <a href="https://github.com/jekyllresources/jekyllresources.github.io">let us know</a>.</p>

<p>This release also marks the start of Jekyll 3 development. I wrote about it
over on my personal blog: <a href="https://byparker.com/blog/2014/jekyll-3-the-road-ahead/">Jekyll 3 â€” The Road Ahead</a>.
Feel free to chime in over on GitHub.</p>

<p>Happy Jekylling!</p>
