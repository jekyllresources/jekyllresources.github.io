I"«	<p>With the release of Jekyll 3.8.0, itâ€™s been 2 and a half years since the last major release. Jekyll 3.0.0 was released in late October of 2015! Thatâ€™s a long time ago, and weâ€™ve been working towards the next major release of Jekyll for a couple of months now. Hereâ€™s a small preview of whatâ€™s to come:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dropping support for Ruby 2.1 and 2.2. Both versions have reached their EOL period.</li>
  <li>Dropping Pygments as a dependency. Weâ€™re already defaulting to Rouge, and this removes the implicit Python dependency. (finally!)</li>
  <li>Making the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">link</code> tag use relative URLs. This is a big breaking change, but itâ€™s the cleaner solution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Weâ€™re open to more ideas, though. If the development cost isnâ€™t too high, or if someone volunteers to take care of the implementation, itâ€™s likely that your suggestion might make it into Jekyll 4.0. Head over to this <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/6948">issue</a> for more details. Some interesting topics might be improving Internationalization support in Jekyll, creating convenience Liquid tags, et cetera.</p>

<p>That being said, the development period of version 4.0 begins <em>now</em>. This means a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New features will only be implemented in Jekyll 4.0. There will be no 3.9.0 or the like.</li>
  <li>Same with bug fixes, unless they concern something introduced in Jekyll 3.7 or 3.8, in which case we will backport the fixes and release a patch version.</li>
  <li>Now is a great time to finally take on the feature youâ€™ve wanted to see in Jekyll for ages! Just open an issue or experiment with the code to get going!</li>
</ul>

<p>As for a release date, weâ€™re currently aiming for late summer, around September or so. However, keep in mind that this project is purely volunteer-run, and as such, delays might occur and we might not hit that release date.</p>

<p>Finally, this is a great time for newcomers to open-source to make their first contribution. Weâ€™ll be doing our best to mark recommended contributions and create newcomer-friendly issues, as well as to provide mentoring throughout the contribution process (although weâ€™d like to think that weâ€™re already pretty proficient at that). So if youâ€™ve always been hestitant about contributing to a large open-source project, Jekyll is a good place to start!</p>

<p>Happy Jekylling! :wave:</p>
