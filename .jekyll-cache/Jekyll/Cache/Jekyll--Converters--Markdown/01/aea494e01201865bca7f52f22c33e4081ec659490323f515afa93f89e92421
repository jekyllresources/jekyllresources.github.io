I"8<p>Coming just 10 days after the release of v1.1.0, v1.1.1 is out with a patch for
the nasty excerpt inception bug (<a href="https://github.com/jekyllresources/jekyllresources.github.io/issues/1339">#1339</a>) and
non-zero exit codes for invalid commands (<a href="https://github.com/jekyllresources/jekyllresources.github.io/issues/1338">#1338</a>).</p>

<p>To all those affected by the <a href="https://github.com/jekyllresources/jekyllresources.github.io/issues/1321">strange excerpt bug in v1.1.0</a>, I’m sorry. I think we have it all patched up and it should be
deployed to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> in the next couple weeks.
Thank you for your patience!</p>
