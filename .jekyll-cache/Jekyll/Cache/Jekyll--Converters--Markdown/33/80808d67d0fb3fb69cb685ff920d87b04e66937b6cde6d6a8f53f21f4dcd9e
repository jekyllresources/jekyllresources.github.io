I"Á<p>Hi! üëã I bring some good news! Jekyll 4.0.0 is finally here! üéâ</p>

<p>There‚Äôs quite a bit in this release to unpack, so let me hit the high points quickly:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ruby 2.4.0 or greater is now required.</li>
  <li>Rouge 3.0 or greater is now required for syntax highlighting.</li>
  <li>Jekyll builds should be much faster.</li>
  <li>Kramdown 2.1 is now the default markdown engine.</li>
  <li>Sass processing should be faster.</li>
  <li>We dropped support for a lot of stuff, specifically:
    <ul>
      <li>Pygments</li>
      <li>RedCarpet</li>
      <li>RDiscount</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Alright, so with the high points out of the way, let‚Äôs get into the details a little bit.</p>

<h3 id="cache-all-the-things-">Cache all the things! üí∞</h3>

<p>While some optimizations first made an appearance with Jekyll 3.8.0, Jekyll 4.0 takes
it to another level altogether.</p>

<p>Jekyll 4.0 caches the processing done by Liquid in memory. So every Liquid
template is processed only as required. If you have 10 pages depending on a
single layout, the layout is cached and that data is then rendered as per the
10 different contexts of the individual files.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs also a disk cache! Jekyll can now cache data to disk to avoid repeated
processing of content that doesn‚Äôt change between build sessions. Currently,
this is limited to markdown. So while the very first build will take a certain
amount of time, consequent builds for content that hasn‚Äôt changed will take
much less time due to the disk-cache. Disk caching is disabled for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">safe</code> mode,
however.</p>

<h3 id="super-powered-content-transformations-">Super-powered content transformations üí™</h3>

<p>We‚Äôve upgraded Sass support so it should be faster. There‚Äôs also
support for sourcemaps now! Under the hood, our Sass support uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SassC</code>
library now, which is supported directly by the Sass team, which should mean
better support for everybody in the long run.</p>

<p>Kramdown is updated to version 2.1. This also brings with it a bunch of changes
to the Kramdown configuration, as the Kramdown team have extracted a fair
number of features into separate gems. Support for GitHub Flavored Markdown is
enabled by default, but if you‚Äôre using another Kramdown extension in your
site, you‚Äôll likely need to update your plugin configuration. See the <a href="/docs/upgrading/3-to-4/">upgrade
guide</a> for more details.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">link</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">post_url</code> tags no longer need <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site.baseurl</code> prepended every
time they‚Äôre used. Those tags now use our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">relative_url</code> filter to take care of
this for you. Existing uses of the prepending pattern will break though!
Sorry! :sweat_smile:</p>

<p>A few other smaller features when it comes to content:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">link</code> tag understands Liquid variables in the same fashion our
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include</code> tag does now.</li>
  <li>Disable Liquid processing for a particular page / document by adding
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">render_with_liquid: false</code> to its front matter.</li>
  <li>Liquid‚Äôs binary <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">and</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">or</code> operations can be used in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">where_exp</code>
 filter for more powerful filtering</li>
</ul>

<p>There‚Äôs some goodies for theme community as well. Developers may now bundle a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.yml</code> into their theme-gem to provide some boilerplate configurations for
the theme. Like other resources in the theme, these configuration values can also
be customized at the user‚Äôs end.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="/docs/history/#v4-0-0">full history</a> and the various pull requests
for more details on all the enhancements and bug-fixes.</p>

<h3 id="upgrading-">Upgrading üìà</h3>

<p>First, read the <a href="/docs/upgrading/3-to-4/">upgrade guide</a>!</p>

<p>Next, Edit your project‚Äôs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code> to test Jekyll v4.x:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">"jekyll"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"~&gt; 4.0"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle update</code> to update all dependencies. Unless you‚Äôre using
third-party plugins that haven‚Äôt yet added support for Jekyll 4.0, you should be
good to go.</p>

<p>Plugins and themes authors must relax the jekyll dependency in their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gemspec</code> file
to allow for Jekyll v4.0:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spec.add_runtime_dependency "jekyll", "&gt;= 3.6", "&lt; 5.0"</code></p>

<p>If your favorite plugin hasn‚Äôt relaxed that dependency yet, please gently
encourage them to do so. :slightly_smiling_face:</p>
