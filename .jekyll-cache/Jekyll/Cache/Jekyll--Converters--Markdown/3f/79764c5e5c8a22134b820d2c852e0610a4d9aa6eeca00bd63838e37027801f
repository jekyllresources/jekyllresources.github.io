After three months of hard (but fun) work with my mentors @benbalter, @jldec, and @parkr, Iâ€™m proud to announce <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin">Jekyll Admin</a>â€™s <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin/releases/tag/v0.1.0">initial release</a>. Jekyll admin is a Jekyll plugin that provides users with a traditional CMS-style graphical interface to author content and administer Jekyll sites.
