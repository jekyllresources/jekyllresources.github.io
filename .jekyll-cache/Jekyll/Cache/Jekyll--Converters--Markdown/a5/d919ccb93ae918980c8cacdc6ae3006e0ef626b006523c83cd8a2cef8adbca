I"å<p>Open Source has a problem with diversity. GitHub recently conducted a <a href="http://opensourcesurvey.org/2017">survey</a> which revealed that 95% of the respondents were identifying as male. This is even worse than in the tech industry overall, where the percentage is only about 76%. Every other week, there seems to be another case of a maintainer engaging in targeted harassment against minorities. People somehow deem it completely okay to let these things slide, though.</p>
