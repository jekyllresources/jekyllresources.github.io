<p class="note info"><strong>This guide is for maintainers.</strong> These special people have <strong>write access</strong> to one or more of Jekyll‚Äôs repositories and help merge the contributions of others. You may find what is written here interesting, but it‚Äôs definitely not for everyone.</p>

<p>We use a series of ‚Äúspecial labels‚Äù on GitHub.com to automate handling of some parts of the pull request and issue process. @jekyllbot may automatically apply or remove certain labels based on actions taken by users or maintainers. Below are the labels and how they work:</p>

<h2 id="pending-feedback"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pending-feedback</code></h2>

<p>This label is used to indicate that we need more information from the issue/PR author in order to continue. It may be that you need more info before you can properly triage a bug report, or that you have some unanswered questions about a PR that need to be resolved before moving forward. You can safely ignore any issue with this label, as it is waiting for feedback.</p>

<h2 id="needs-work--pending-rebase"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">needs-work</code> &amp; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pending-rebase</code></h2>

<p>These labels are used to indicate that the Git state of a pull request must change. Both are removed once a push is registered (a ‚Äúsynchronize‚Äù event for the pull request) and the pull request becomes mergable. Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">needs-work</code> to a PR if, after your review, it requires code changes. Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pending-rebase</code> to a PR if the code is fine but the branch is not automatically mergable with the target branch (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>).</p>

<h2 id="stale"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stale</code></h2>

<p>This label is automatically added and removed by @jekyllbot based on activity on an issue or pull request. The rules for this label are laid out in <a href="../triaging-an-issue/#staleness-and-automatic-closure">Triaging an Issue: Staleness and automatic closure</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pinned"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pinned</code></h2>

<p>This label is for @jekyllbot to ignore the age of the issue, which means that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stale</code> label won‚Äôt be automatically added, and the issue won‚Äôt be closed after a while. This needs to be set manually, and should be set with care. (The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">has-pull-request</code> label does the same thing, but shouldn‚Äôt be used to <em>only</em> keep an issue open)</p>
